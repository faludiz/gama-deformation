About

GNU Gama package is dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks. It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

Adjustment in local coordinate systems is fully supported by a
command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free) networks
of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D
vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
.sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig file
and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

  gpg --verify gama-2.12.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 1b77fc09

and rerun the 'gpg --verify' command.

Changes in release 2.12 (2020-11-28)

* Alternative support of input data based on YAML format. YAML support
  was added for gama-local as an alternative to the existing XML input
  format. The YAML support is currently limited only to a conversion
  program gama-local-yaml2gkf but it may be fully integrated in
  gama-local program later.
