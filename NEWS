GNU Gama NEWS - History of user-visible changes.

Changes in release 2.17 (2022-01-07)

  A maintenance release, no user-visible changes.

Changes in release 2.16 (2021-11-25)

  A maintenance release, the only user-visible changes are new
  gama-local option --export (renamed from --updated-xml) and some
  more tests ins gama-local sets suite.


Changes in release 2.15 (2021-09-20)

  A maintenance release, no user-visible changes.


Changes in release 2.14 (2021-02-28)

* Maintainers release

* fixed html output format.

  The html format in GNU gama was correct, but in Qgama the table of
  adjusted coordinates with colspan attributes the Qt widget
  QtTextEdit rendered the table wrong and all <td> tags had to be
  written explicitly.


Changes in release 2.13 (2021-01-15)

* Conversions between yaml and input xml (gkf) tested for all
  available data files in the tests suite (subdirectory gama-local).

* Command line programs gama-local, gama-local-yaml2gkf and
  gama-local-gkf2yaml can now read input data from standard input.

* New exlicit parameter --input-xml in gama-local (previously input
  file was the first parameter)

* Fixed test of ratio apriori/aposteriori values (localnetworkxml.cpp)

* Fixed implicit model for distance stddev (gama-local adjustment model)

* Fixed new attribute angular in documentation


Changes in release 2.12 (2020-11-28)

* Alternative support of input data based on YAML format. YAML support
  was added for gama-local as an alternative to the existing XML input
  format. The YAML support is currently limited only to a conversion
  program gama-local-yaml2gkf but it may be fully integrated in
  gama-local program later.


Release 2.11 October 2020

* Maintainers' release

* Removed gnu-gama-data.dtd and all its references (superseded by
  .xsd), several XML files were updated in tests/gama-g3 to use
  gnu-gama-data xsd definition.


Release 2.10 September 2020

* Adjustment results output in Octave format (.m file) with independent
  test of adjustment results (regularization of singular systems by
  the set of constraints).

* update-constrained-coordinates parameter removed from the input XML
  data format


Release 2.09 June 2020

* There is one major fix visible to end users. Implicit value of XML
  parameter 'update_constrained_coordinates' was changed to "yes". The
  behavior of adjustment calculation was well and clearly described in
  the documentation, but in some cases the old implicit value ("no")
  might have led to poor numerical results. The input data XML
  parameter 'update_constrained_coordinates' is preserved only for
  backward compatibility and is likely to be removed in some future
  release.

  This release is a kind of preparation stage for the next release
  where 'update-constrained-coordinates' parameter shall be removed
  from the input XML data format.


Release 2.08 December 2019

Maintainer's release

* new test data krasovsky-1926 with full reference in biblatex
  (renamed from bug-2019-04-23-oleg-goussev)

* new unit test for extern attributes in gama-local/scripts/check_externs.cpp

* new HACKING.md by Greg Troxel explicitly declares that autotools are
  the primary build system and alternative build like CMake must never
  influence the primary Gama builds.

* Legacy builds with expat-1.1 is available only as an testing option

* C++ sources cleanup mainly in lib/gama/local to conform with C++11

* C++11 standard is explicitly set in configure.ac (for testing C++14
  is set on in the alternative builds in the main CMakeLists.txt)


Release 2.07 August 2019

* Fixed some bugs in AcordPolar and AcordTraverse classes.
  More algorithms in Acord2 class

Release 2.06 July 2019

* Fixed two bugs (html output format and segmentation fault)

Release 2.05 May 2019

* The program gama-local for adjustment of local surveying networks
  used a C++ class Acord for computing approximate coordinates of
  adjusted points, if these were not explicitly given on
  input. Acord's computations were based on intersections (and local
  transformations if necessary) of the tuples of determining
  observations (for example a bearing and a distance). Gama-local
  expected input data to be free of blunders, which might be a strong
  assumption in practice.

  New class Acord2 was introduced as a robust alternative for typical
  two dimensional input configurations (Acord2 is not a complete
  general solution yet); the idea is to find all (or as many as possible)
  solutions of coordinates of a selected point and use their median as
  the robust position estimation. Algorithm Acord2 is followed by the
  original Acord intersections in gama-local, before the adjustment
  solution of the network. Acord2 is based on the master's thesis by
  Petra Millarová <petramillarova@gmail.com>

Release 2.04 March 2019

* experimental qmake project file gama-local.pro to be used where
cmake is not available with Qt distribution on Windows. CMakeLists.txt
project is prefered over gama-local.pro.

Release 2.03 February 2019

* The new attribute "extern" suggested by Kristian Evers (Danish
  Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency) was added both to the
  gama-local xml input and adjustment results xml output to be
  conformant with an external database project. Information supplied in
  "extern" attributes of observations are not processed in any way in
  gama-local and are only passively transfered to XML adjustement
  output.

Release 2.02 November 2018

* Improved Hungarian translation by Siki Zoltan:
   "I would like to inform you that we just have finished a guide to
   networks used in engineering surveying. It will be a booklet of the
   Hungarian Chamber of Engineers. It mostly contains practical guide of
   the network adjustment and blunders detection. In the examples GNU
   Gama was used (and GeoEasy).
   During this work we have improved the Hungarian translation."

Release 2.01 September 2018

* Maintainer's release
* Conditional build for gama-g3 enabled implicitly
* XML schema definition for gama-g3 adjustment results with new
  xmllint testsuite

Release 2.00 May 2018

* Maintainer's release: for the list of internal changes see ChangeLog

Release 1.21 November 2017

* Maintainer's release : internal matrix/vectors memory management
  replaced with a new implementation using C++11 move constructor and
  move asignment syntax.

Release 1.20 November 2017

* New test suite for matvec classes and support for valgrind memory
  leak tests for tests/matvec and tests/gama-local.

     This release is a preperation phase for the next release in which
     the base matvec memory handling class (MemRep) will reimplemented
     with C++11 move constructor and move assignemnt operator.

Release 1.19 June 2017

* fixed a bug introduced in 1.16, reported by Pierre Bosser
        <pierre.bosser@ensta-bretagne.fr>. Implicit value of
        covariance band in XML adjustment output is -1 (full
        bandwidth).

Release 1.18 August 2016

* configure.ac : patch by Greg Troxel <gdt@lexort.com>
     CPPFLAGS was set with +=, which is a bash extension and fails on
     POSIX-conforming shells.  This resulted in sqlite3 support not being
     enabled on NetBSD, even though the sqlite3 library was found and
     linked in.
* fixed some minor problems reported by Greg Troxel (doc, NEWS)
* in local/network.cpp commented out // removed_obs.clear();
* fixed a formatting bug in outlaying terms (due to c++11)
* fixed a bug in HTML parser test
* simplified class LocalPoint
* fixed a bug in sql export reported by Dominik Hladik
* added @documentencoding UTF-8 into gama.texi

Release 1.17 November 2015

* new set of functions for handling inconsistent systems
* fixed two bugs reported by Greg Troxel

Release 1.16 July 2015

* minor fixes in documentation
* fixed a bug in SQL schema
* new export of XML network definition
* C++11 features enabled (-std=c++11 for g++ compiler)
* fixed several minor bugs

Release 1.15 February 2014

* DTD replaced with XSD for gama-local.xsd and
  gama-local-adjustment.xsd. Attribute version describing XML version
  of input and adjustment outpup XML documents became useles with
  introduction of XSD a was removed from tags <gama-local> and
  <gama-local-adjustment>. Some more elements attributes were
  introduced in revised XML formats which are incompatible with older
  versions.

Release 1.14 June 2013

* A posteriori standard deviation Chi-Square test is newly always
  performed (even when gama-local uses a priori reference standard
  deviation).

* Added Chinese translation in GBK encoding (switch "zh")

* New output format XHTML Strict 1.0 in gama-local

* Added a basic test suite for gama-local (make check).
